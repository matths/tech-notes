# tech-notes

In this repository I put technical notes, cookbooks, documentations, how to setup, config or automize things without a full blown blog attitude.

It is a memory aid to be able to remember or reproduce or enhance stuff already done.

Most of the stuff is or will be related to hobby projects like setup of my vps, building website, apps or games, etc.
Many things will be around linux, bash, nodejs.

## motivation

* save knowledge already obtained
* ease recovery in case of loss
* do not search the same stuff again
* consolidate working processes
* learn by doing and writing
